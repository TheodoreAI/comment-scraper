I fell in love and 25 years later I&#39;m still writing Python almost every day and still loving it.

Beautiful is better than ugly.
Explicit is better than implicit.
Simple is better than complex.
Complex is better than complicated.
Flat is better than nested.
Sparse is better than dense.
Readability counts.
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.

Errors should never pass silently.
Unless explicitly silenced.
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.

If you find yourself even slightly considering attending pycon for the first time, I highly recommend going! The inspiration you'll get is alone worth the $ but there's even more to be gained by going. 

I went to Pycon US 2024 and there's Guido just casually walking around exploring like me. He doesn't blend into the crowd but he's there on the same level with the nobodies like me, enjoying pycon. There is no separation of elite and noobs. Just an awesome community.
